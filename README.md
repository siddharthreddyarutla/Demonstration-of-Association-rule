This experiment illustrates some of the basic elements of asscociation rule mining
using WEKA. The sample dataset used for this example is test.arff

Step1: Open the data file in Weka Explorer. It is presumed that the required data fields have
been discretized. In this example it is age attribute.

Step2: Clicking on the associate tab will bring up the interface for association rule algorithm.

Step3: We will use apriori algorithm. This is the default algorithm.

Step4: Inorder to change the parameters for the run (example support, confidence etc) we
click on the text box immediately to the right of the choose button.
